README file for Cuckoo Hashing dictionary library and example program
----------------------------------------------------------------------


BACKGROUND
----------------------------------------------------------------------

For a describtion of Cuckoo Hashing we refer to the paper
CUCKOO HASHING, by Rasmus Pagh and Flemming Friche Rodler,
accepted for European Symposium on Algorithms 2001.

The paper and source code is available in electronic form from the
authors' homepages: www.brics.dk/~pagh/ and www.brics.dk/~ffr/


FILES
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You should have the following files:

README
alice.dat
alice.in 
cuckoo.c
cuckoo.h
ddriver.h
ddriver.c


cuckoo.c: Library file containing the dictionary operations of cuckoo
          hashing.

ddriver.c: Example driver program. Can be used to test the operations
           of cuckoo.c. The file is a heavily modified version of the
           ddriver.c program from the  5th DIMACS implementation
           challenge.

alice.dat: Test file taken from the 5th DIMACS implementation
           challenge.

alice.in: "Conversion" of alice.dat to the format accepted by the
          driver program (assuming that an int is 32 bits).


USAGE
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The test program can be compiled using gcc as:

     gcc cuckoo.c ddriver.c -o cuckoo -lm -ansi -Wall -pedantic

The program is run on the example file as follows:
     cuckoo [tablesize] < alice.in
[tablesize] is an optional parameter specifying initial size of
the hash tables. A trace file is produced if the DETAIL flag in
ddriver.h was set.

NOTES
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Below are some notes regarding the implementation of cuckoo hashing.

1) Keys are nonzero integer values (type int). The value 0 is used to
   mark empty cells and cannot be used as a key.

2) The dictionary is robust in that it correctly handles attempts to
   insert an element already in the set and attempts to delete an
   element not in the set.

3) The dictionary is designed to keep the load factor between 0.2 and
   0.5. At these two load factors the hash tables are either doubled
   or halved, and a rehash occurs.

4) If not all keys can be accommodated a rehash occurs. If the load
   factor is above 5/12 the table sizes are doubled.

5) The program was tested on a Linux PC, but should work on other
   platforms as well.
